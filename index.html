                    <p>The Story of my Life<br>
I have a very fulfilling feeling about what I have <br>been able to accomplish in my life so far.<br> I want the absolute best for myself and those close to me.<br> I often go above and beyond to help those around me succeed <br>and be the best version of themselves that they can possibly be. <br>
My life is a mixture of moments, some happy moments<br> and others not so much but regardless, these moments<br> have made me the person <br>that I am today and I donâ€™t regret anything that had happen.<br> I consider myself a strong, and a very determined person,<br> I have dreams to fill the world and I am willing to do <br>the necessary efforts to attain those dreams. <br>My motivations I inherit from my family,<br> more specifically my father that I love so much..
